An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables AI systems to control the joint positions of a simulated robot arm in MuJoCo. It includes a robot kinematics informed prompt for the task of matching the joint configuration of reference images from a real robot.

For example, after prompting cursor's claude 4 agent to match these photos:

![Reference images](assets/test_15efc020ad_0.png)![Reference images](assets/test_b59c1bd94b_0.png)

It first tried this joint configuration:

![Initial joint configuration](assets/first_joint_state.png)

And it finally stopped iterating on the fifth try claiming success with a confidence that only an LLM can muster. While its final joint configuration is quite close to the reference images, is not quite there.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jccalvojackson/mujoco-mcp.git
   cd mujoco-mcp
   ```

You can install it in your favourite MCP client (cursor, etc.) with the follwing config:

```json
    "mujoco-mcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/mujoco-mcp/",
        "/path/to/mujoco-mcp/src/mujoco_mcp/server.py"
      ]
    },
```

Alternatively, you can test it with the MCP inspector:

```bash
uv run mcp dev src/mujoco_mcp/server.py
```

### Usage with MCP-enabled AI Agents

The server exposes a single tool and prompt for AI agents:

**Tool:** `set_robot_state_and_render(state: list[float])`
- **Input:** Joint positions as a list of floats (6 values for so_arm100)
- **Output:** WebP image grid showing 4 camera viewpoints of the robot
- **Behavior:** Stateless - robot resets to home position after each call

**Prompt:** "Achieve pose"
- Provides detailed instructions for iterative pose matching
- Guides the AI through analysis, planning, and refinement steps

## ü§ñ Supported Robot Models

The MuJoCo MCP server supports **50 different robot models** that are compatible with MuJoCo's MJCF format. The default robot is `so_arm100_mj_description` (a 6-DOF robotic arm).

### Configuration

You can change the robot model by setting the environment variable:

```bash
export MUJOCO_MCP_ROBOT_NAME=<robot_name>
```

Or create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
MUJOCO_MCP_ROBOT_NAME=<robot_name>
```

> **Note:** Each robot model has different joint configurations and ranges. The MCP tool will automatically adapt to the selected robot's joint structure and provide appropriate bounds information to AI agents.

## üõ†Ô∏è TODO

- [ ] Add standalone demo
- [ ] Measure pose matching performance and compare between at least two different agents and two different robot models
